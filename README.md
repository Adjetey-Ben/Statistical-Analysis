Statistical Analysis of Farm Yield in Ghana's Middle Belt

This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of farm yield in the middle belt of Ghana, focusing on five farms: Ejura, Atebubu, Wenchi, Kintampo, and Krachi. Our goal is to understand the relationships between various environmental factors and crop yield. The key variables under consideration are:

    Independent Variables: Temperature, Sunshine, Rainfall, Relative Humidity, Soil Moisture
    Dependent Variable: Yield

Key Analyses Included:

    Correlation Plots and Metrics:
        Visualizing and quantifying the relationships between the independent variables and yield.

    Linear Regression:
        Modeling the relationship between a single independent variable and yield.

    Multiple Regression:
        Exploring the combined effect of multiple independent variables on yield.

    Collinearity Analysis:
        Identifying and addressing multicollinearity among the independent variables.

    Anomaly Detection:
        Detecting and visualizing anomalies in the dataset.

The analysis provides insights that can help in optimizing farming practices and improving yield in the region. All code and data are available for reproducibility and further exploration.
